                    I am a seasoned worker who has used my experience in the industry to
                    develop a leadership brand that precedes myself. I am trusted by my
                    peers, and senior leadership because of my consistent commitment to
                    go beyond the expectation. My team engagement is admirable, and my
                    greatest strength is my ability to build genuine trust relationships
                    with all my peers. I have backbone and i am vocal about my opinions
                    always in the best way possible. I am not afraid to put in the
                    effort required to deliver, even if it means coming in early or on
                    an off day not because i am unable to manage my time, but because i
                    always insist on higher standards and knows what it takes to achieve
                    those standards. I am also emotionally balanced and always
                    approaches situations with an open mind. I always strive to operate
                    in the best interest of the business while still managing to factor
                    the human elements that contribute to every scenario.
